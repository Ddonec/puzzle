###Greetings:

Greetings to you, dear peers and mentors. My name is Anton, and I am a junior frontend developer. Today I would like to share with you my path in programming and tell you about my professional plans.

###Education:

I'm taking a course at RS School. I have always been fond of technology and decided to take a plunge into the world of web development. In the process of learning I improved my development skills and by now I can say that I have a good level of basic things like HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS. I know how to work with cookies and local storage. I know what node js is, I understand how to run code outside the browser, I know how preprocessors like sass and scss work. I also know how to work with Git, a version control and storage system, as well as the web interface and GitHub application. 
I originally started my journey by learning the basics of html and css in order to prepare for the stage 0 course which started in June 2023. 

I do not originally have a major in education and have not run into anything like this my entire life. My life has earlier been about physical things and communicating with them. I am fluent in repairing and servicing machinery, I am a good driver, and I even owned a furniture business, making interior solutions and custom furniture. But now I have completely left that and changed my line of work. 

###Goals and motivation:

My main goal is to become an experienced web developer and contribute to the creation of interesting and innovative web projects. I am motivated by the constant quest for excellence, and every new programming challenge or problem becomes an opportunity for me to grow and develop.

###Projects:

During my studies I actively worked on various projects Each project became not only an opportunity for me to practice, but also to learn more about new technologies and development methods.

During my studies on stage 0 and stage 1 course I created both full-fledged projects: library and coffee shop, and separate small solutions or applications using different technologies like API for example. I have created a cast audio player, an image gallery, different games from runners to more difficult ones that involve fully dynamic rendering of content on a page and partly webpack and OOP development technology that helped me to pull off one or another skill in development. 
One of the most recent is a hangman game
I also have experience as a freelancer where I have had the opportunity to develop web applications and do website layout. These experiences have helped me to better understand development processes and learn how to work effectively in a team.

###Work Experience:

During this time, I even found a part-time freelance job where I had to develop the logic of a web application, and I successfully coped with the task, but I also have experience in website page layout, but in the real world I came across the difficulties of adapting the ready-made correct code, as I believe, under the Wordpress system, which works in a different language : PHP, I had to learn it hot, if I may say so, and it was my most difficult task for all the time in development at the moment. You could say that I was rewriting a ready-made, optimized year, under an old system, and complicating it at the request of the customer. It felt weird at this point. 

###Development:

In the future, I plan to continue my education and grow in the field of web development. I am willing to learn new technologies and techniques to become the best expert in my field.

There were still challenges that I faced and solved, one of the last ones is that I was able to create an event listener that worked in such a way that it did not access an element by a specific Id or class name, but worked in a loop, in fact there can be an infinite number of the same elements, each of which will have a listener. As a result, this listener would each time loop through another list of other identical elements and change the data in the element with the right number.
But there is of course a defect here: namely, it is the complexity of n squared, which was not taken into account during development due to the condition of a small number of nested objects.

###Completion:

In the end I would like to say that I like programming very much and it is close to my heart, every problem or difficult task only helps me to develop, after this I become more experienced and stronger in the subject. I plan to grow in the direction of web development and improve my skills and experience. Contact me if I can be of any help to you 
and thanks for your time, I wish you well and have a nice day!
