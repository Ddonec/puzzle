### And i will start learn TypeScript wimth microsoft platform


## Complete 1st level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/K5MHUFDB?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned what TypwScript is, how to install dependencies and prepare an IDE to work with TS 

For example:(i can use comand "npm install -g typescript" for insstall TS to global)


## Complete 2nd level and get achivvment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/X2HDQ3LY?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned how to declare variables using primitive principles, using various objects, using the definitions of union and interaction.

For example:(primitive types are the boolean, number, string, void, null, and undefined)

## Complete 3rd level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/9N5MN24U?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned how to use interfaces in TypeScript, as well as declare interfaces with custom array types.

For example: (
    Required - All properties are required, unless otherwise specified.
    Optional - Add a question mark (?) to the end of the property name. Use this for properties that are not required. This prevents the type system from raising an error if the property is omitted.
    Read only - Add the readonly keyword in front of the property name. Use this for properties that should only be modified when an object is first created.)

## Complere 4th level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/J6PX4UVT?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this fourth module I learned about the benefits of using types in functions. Learned the required, optional, default and other options. Learned how to define function types using type aliases and interfaces.

For example:(Named functions, Anonymous functions, Arrow functions. Required parameters, optional parameters, default parameters, rest Parameters)

## Complete 5th level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/BLQREWHD?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

I studied module 5 and became familiar with classes in TypeScript. Now I know how to declare classes, use classes to describe the shape of objects, create an instance of a class, use class access modifiers, define static properties in a class, declare a class that extends another class.

Know when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

for example:(public, private, protected. constuctor. set, get. extend, implements)

## Complete 6th level ang get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/FZ3L27QX?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

I learned about using generics, defining a generic function, declaring a generic interface, and declaring a generic class.
I can also now use restrictions.

For example:(function nameFunction<T>(items : T[]) : T[]{function make}. interface i<T, U> {v1: v2: U})

## Complete 7th level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/ZPX35UQ2?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned how to organize code using modules and import external type library.

For example:(export, import. --module command, dotenv library .env file)

## Complete 8th level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/WA9SK9BN?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned about namespaces, implemented namespaces, implemented multi-file namespaces. Now I understand the design considerations of using namespaces and modules.

For example:(namespace, /// syntax and reference)



## conclusion:

In general, I understand the properties and methods that are used in Type Script, I understand that this language is closely related to the principles of object-oriented programming, but I still donâ€™t clearly understand how I will use it in my work, I think that with practice I will understand better
