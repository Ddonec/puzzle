## Complete 1st level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/K5MHUFDB?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned what TypwScript is, how to install dependencies and prepare an IDE to work with TS 
For example:(i can use comand "npm install -g typescript" for insstall TS to global)


## Complete 2nd level and get achivvment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/X2HDQ3LY?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned how to declare variables using primitive principles, using various objects, using the definitions of union and interaction.
For example:(primitive types are the boolean, number, string, void, null, and undefined)

## Complete 3rd level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/9N5MN24U?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this module I learned how to use interfaces in TypeScript, as well as declare interfaces with custom array types.
For example: (
    Required - All properties are required, unless otherwise specified.
    Optional - Add a question mark (?) to the end of the property name. Use this for properties that are not required. This prevents the type system from raising an error if the property is omitted.
    Read only - Add the readonly keyword in front of the property name. Use this for properties that should only be modified when an object is first created.)

## Complere 4th level and get achivment: [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Ddonec-5394/J6PX4UVT?sharingId=51056E77C4FF8916)

In this fourth module I learned about the benefits of using types in functions. Learned the required, optional, default and other options. Learned how to define function types using type aliases and interfaces.
For example:(Named functions, Anonymous functions, Arrow functions. Required parameters, optional parameters, default parameters, rest Parameters)
